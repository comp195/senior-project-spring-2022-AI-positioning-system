Project Describes                                                                                          
About
Use Artificial Intelligence algorithms to find images that are similar to scanned images. And extract the text to determine. The use this text and table to locat the picture. I'm going to test this with photos from different databases. The Photos1 and photos2 groups are different and it come from different cities and places.        
This project can help you find the location of the photo you want. And there's a certain probability of finding its exact location. There are plenty of similar photos to be found.

Include 4 part
1. similarity of pictures:
Use Python3 code to scan the picture. Then, compare the scanned images with images in the image database and find similar images.
2. Find text or numbers in picture: 
Extract words and numbers from highly similar images. And. Will repeat the number. Color code.
3. Check all city, state and country name:
(Use training model to find the name)
From maximum to minimum, pick the number that repeats the most, or. Text and use the item. Text to get the location.
4. Test project:
At the end of the project, I will test all the deta and code. Then, calculate the correct rate.
picture_detabase is use my detabase picture to test it. which include group 1 and group2.

Special notes:  3/17 There is currently a problem with the text in the scanner and the text &number extraction. My code cannot precise, and location the white block for the text. I research about some Scan the picture use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) essay and paper to help me to solve the problem of clarity, but it does not work for now. The current progress about finding similarities is complete but not tested yet. The image database for the first group has been compiled, and there are three similar images. And the first image has print text.


Technologies and Software Used:                        
Python; Pycharm, tesseract-OCR web

Picture Detabase (this detabase will include 500 pictures and it's include some samiliar pictures. All the text and number is print number/text)

Callenges: (find text & number):
The tesseract-OCR web may not very fit my requirements. So, I need to keep changing my code to make sure my  Optical Character Recognition(OCR) code can get clear text and number info from pictures.
