Project describes                                                                                          
About
Use Artificial Intelligence algorithms to find images that are similar to scanned images. And extract the text to determine. The use this text and table to locat the picture. I'm going to test this with photos from different databases. The Photos1 and photos2 groups are different and it come from different cities and places.                  
This project can help you find the location of the photo you want. And there's a certain probability of finding its exact location. There are plenty of similar photos to be found.
Include 4 part
1. similarity of pictures:
Use Python3 code to scan the picture. Then, compare the scanned images with images in the image database and find similar images.
2. Find text or numbers in picture: 
Extract words and numbers from highly similar images. And. Will repeat the number. Color code.
3. Check all city, state and country name:
From maximum to minimum, pick the number that repeats the most, or. Text and use the item. Text to get the location.
4. Test project:
At the end of the project, I will test all the deta and code. Then, calculate the correct rate.
